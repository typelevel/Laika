Features
========

Laika is a customizable and extensible toolkit for transforming lightweight text markup 
and template based site and e-book generation.

It can be used in a range of usage scenarios:

* As an sbt plugin as part of your build and CI pipeline, e.g. for generating Scala project documentation

* As part of your build with other build tools such as Mill through its library API.

* In server-side Scala applications, e.g. for transforming user input in markup syntax or as part of document 
  processing pipelines
  
* In browser-based applications via its library API which is published for Scala.js

* Scaling up to producing complex e-books and sites from dozens of inputs, to scaling down to transform
  a snippet of Markdown with three lines of code.
  
  
Supported Platforms
-------------------

Laika can be used as:

* A plugin for sbt version 1.x.

* A library on the JVM with Scala 3, 2.13 or 2.12.

* A library in Scala.js 1.5+ applications with all its features except File/Stream IO, EPUB and PDF output

For getting started see the documentation of the [sbt Plugin] or [Library API].


Supported Formats
-----------------

* Markdown including GitHub Flavor

* reStructuredText including its standard directives

* HOCON for configuration and directive attributes, based on Laika's own parser

* HTML site generation based on templates

* [E-Books (EPUB & PDF)] with auto-generated navigation

* Lightweight default theme with configurable styling for site, EPUB and PDF output
  with extensive [Theme Settings].


Content Organization
--------------------

* [Validated Internal Links] in "native" text markup syntax, based on relative paths or [Linking by Section Headline]. 

* Avoid repetition and centralize all external URLs used in links with [Global Link Definitions].

* Use Laika's [Standard Directives] for automatically [Generating Navigation Trees] or [Breadcrumbs],
  optionally with [Auto-Numbering].

* Use integrated parsers for [Syntax Highlighting] that work for all output formats. 
  Supported out of the box are Scala, Dotty, Java, Python, JavaScript (JSX), TypeScript (TSX), Haskell,
  HTML, CSS, XML, YAML, JSON, HOCON, SQL, Shell/Bash, EBNF, Alloy, Dhall, Dart
  
* Freely organize and merge content from multiple input directories or generated in-memory 
  with the library's [Virtual Tree Abstraction].
  
* Produce [Versioned Documentation] based on simple configuration steps and an integrated version switcher
  dropdown in the default Helium theme.
  
* Use the integrated [Preview Server](../02-running-laika/01-sbt-plugin.md#using-the-preview-server) 
  with live updates to preview your site while editing.


Library API
-----------
  
* Use a purely functional API, with full referential transparency, no exceptions and no runtime reflection.

* Abstracts all effectful computations behind a polymorphic effect type based on `cats-effect` 3.x typeclasses, 
  so that any compatible library can be used with Laika.


Customizations
--------------

* Create your own look & feel by [Creating Themes] or adjust the built-in theme by [Creating Templates].

* Process and transform [The Document AST] between parsing and rendering by [AST Rewriting].
  
* Adjust the rendered output for individual AST node types by [Overriding Renderers].


Extensibility
-------------

* Extend the syntax of text markup languages, either by [Implementing Directives] or by [Writing Parser Extensions].

* Support additional languages for Laika's built-in highlighter by [Adding Syntax Highlighters].

* Use simple contracts and APIs for adding [New Markup or Output Formats].

* Write all parsers based on [Laika's Parser Combinators] which are optimized for multi-pass markup parsing.
