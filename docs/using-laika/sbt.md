Using the sbt Plugin
====================

The core of the Laika toolkit does not depend on sbt in any way, and therefore comes with a plugin
that provides the glue necessary to expose Laika's feature set as sbt tasks and settings.

This chapter only covers the topics which are specific to using Laika with sbt, while most other
parts of the manual apply to both embedded use and sbt plugin.



Adding the Plugin to the Build
------------------------------

Laika's sbt plugin requires sbt 0.13.x.

First add the plugin to `project/plugins.sbt`:

    addSbtPlugin("org.planet42" % "laika-sbt" % "0.5.0")

If you want to install it globally, add the line above to
`~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/build.sbt` instead.

Then, in your project's `build.sbt`, simply import the default settings:

    LaikaPlugin.defaults
    
You can now add content to the directory `src/docs` inside your project 
and run `laika:site` from within sbt to generate the site in 
`target/docs/site`. See the following sections for details.



Editing Content
---------------

Laika expects the site content to be organized in a directory. By default this is
`src/docs`. In contrast to several similar tools content in Laika is hierarchical.
Subdirectories can contain markup files, too, and the hierarchy can get
visualized in a table of contents. Furthermore you can also specify additional
directories to be merged into the main directory, which allows to keep reusable
templates and styles (other tools would call it "themes") in a separate place.

The directories can contain different types of files:

* All of the supported text markup formats (currently this is Markdown and reStructuredText).
  The default parser of the plugin allows to use both formats in the same document
  tree (including cross linking between the two formats) and recognizes them by the
  file suffix (`.md` or `.markdown` for Markdown and `.rst` for reStructuredText). 

* A configuration file `directory.conf` which allows to specify the document order
  for navigation, the directory title, autonumbering options and other settings.
  
* A template file `default.template.html` that gets applied to all markup files in 
  this directory (and its subdirectories unless overridden). A very basic template
  may look like this:

        <html>
          <head>
            <title>{{document.title}}</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <div class="content">
              {{document.content}}
            </div>
          </body>
        </html>
    
  The two placeholders enclosed in double curly braces will be replaced with the
  title and content of the parsed markup document.
  
* Other static files that simply get copied to the target directory.

For more details on the template engine, see the chapter [Templates].

For features like titles, sections, cross-linking, auto-numbering, 
document order and tables of content, see the chapter [Document Structure].

For details about Markdown and reStructuredText see the chapter
[Supported Markup].



Laika Tasks for sbt
-------------------

Laika currently supports three main tasks meant to be used from the command line:

* `laika:site`  
  Processes all files from the source directories and renders the 
  result to `target/docs/site` (unless overridden). 

* `laika:packageSite`  
  Packages the site into a zip file inside the `target/docs`
  directory.

* `laika:clean`  
  Deletes the contents of Laika's target directory only. Alternatively
  you can also run the global `clean` task which will delete content generated by
  Laika together with the target directories of other tasks.
  
The next two versions of the plugin will add support for PDF generation (0.6)
and epub (0.7).
  
The default settings for these tasks should be sufficient for many use cases.
The following sections show how you can override the defaults. 



Basic Settings
--------------

The basic structure of a build with custom Laika settings looks like this:

    import LaikaKeys._

    name := "..."

    organization := "..."

    version := "0.1"

    LaikaPlugin.defaults

    <key> in Laika := <value>
    
    <key> in Laika := <value>
    
    [...]

Where `<key>` is one of the setting keys listed below.

All keys for the Laika plugin are scoped to the Laika configuration, as the keys
are a mix of reused built-in keys and custom Laika keys.

If you don't want to specify the Laika configuration with every setting you 
can also use an alternative syntax:

    inConfig(Laika)(Seq(
      <key> := <value>,
      <key> := <value>
    ))

The downside of this syntax is that you cannot use blank lines between settings 
(in .sbt files).

The following list shows the names, types and default values of the basic settings:


* `sourceDirectories` - `Seq[File]` - default `Seq("src/docs")`  
  Specifies one or more
  source directories to process. All specified directories can contain any of the supported
  file types and will get merged into a tree with a single root.

* `target` - `File` - default `target/docs`  
  Specifies the directory where the plugin
  should generate the site. This key also has separate values scoped to the individual tasks:
  `target in site` (default `target/docs/site`), `target in copyAPI` (default `target/docs/site/api`)
  and `target in packageSite` (default `target/docs`). 

* `excludeFilter` - `FileFilter` - default `HiddenFileFilter`  
  Specifies files to exclude from processing.
  Note that Laika ignores any `includeFilter` you set, as the tool needs more than a simple yes/no
  decision for deciding how to process files. If a simple exclusion filter is not sufficient, you can
  specify a `docTypeMatcher` as explained in [Settings for Customization Hooks].

* `includeAPI` - `Boolean` - default `false`  
  Indicates whether generated scaladoc APIs should be
  copied to the site. The folder for the API can be set with `target in copyAPI` (default `target/docs/site/api`).

* `encoding` - `String` - default `UTF-8`  
  Specifies the character encoding for input and output.

* `strict` - `Boolean` - default `false`  
  Indicates whether all Laika-specific extensions to the 
  text markup formats should be disabled. When strict is set to true, features like configuration
  headers in markup files or Laika directives are no longer available.

* `rawContent` - `Boolean` - default `false`  
  Indicates whether raw content like embedded verbatim
  HTML is supported in text markup. Setting this flag to true has different effects for the two
  supported markup formats: In Markdown it enables support for raw HTML interspersed with text markup
  like specified in the original Markdown syntax description, in reStructuredText it enables the standard 
  `raw` directive which allows to embed content in any target format (although in the context of this plugin
  only HTML would make sense). 

* `logMessageLevel` - `Option[MessageLevel]` - default `Some(Warning)`  
  Specifies the log level for
  problems found in markup files, like unresolved link references or directives. For most of these
  errors the parser recovers and includes the illegal node as plain text in the output, but in most
  cases you want to fix these issues and these logs help with that. `Info` and `Debug` levels are
  currently not used by Laika.

* `renderMessageLevel` - `Option[MessageLevel]` - default `None`  
  In addition to just logging errors,
  illegal nodes can also be rendered to the target HTML, so you can see them in context. The messages
  are rendered with a span with two classes: `system-message` and the second specifying the level (`error`,
  `warning`, etc.), so you can add CSS to easily identify these nodes in the page.

* `parallel` - `Boolean` - default `true`  
  Indicates whether the parsers and renderers should be 
  processed in parallel. If set to true, there is only a short synchronization step between parsing
  and rendering where things like cross references get resolved. Most of
  the heavy work before and after that can be done for all input and output files in parallel.



Settings for Customization Hooks
--------------------------------

Laika allows to easily add custom logic to the processing of documents. When all you need to
adjust is the processing of one or more particular nodes types, a simple partial function allows
to do that while still benefiting from the defaults for all other node types.

When working with the document tree (the internal AST representing the document structure),
it is most comfortable to add the following imports to the build:

    import laika.tree.Documents._
    import laika.tree.Elements._


### Custom Renderers

A custom renderer allows to override the generated output for one or more specific node
types, while falling back to the default renderers for all other node types.

The `siteRenderers` setting is of type `Seq[HTMLWriter => RenderFunction]` where `RenderFunction`
is a type alias for `PartialFunction[Element,Unit]`. `Element` is the base trait for all nodes
in a document tree. By default the `siteRenderers` setting is empty, meaning
Laika will use the default renderers for all node types. 

The following simple example shows how you can add a style to the renderer for
the `<em>` tag:

    siteRenderers in Laika += siteRenderer { out => {
      case Emphasized(content, _) => 
          out << """<em class="big">""" << content << "</em>" 
    }}
    
For more details see the chapter [Customizing Renderers].


### Custom Rewrite Rules

When customizing renderers you have to repeat the step for each output format (subsequent
versions will add support for PDF and epub). A rewrite rule lets you express a transformation
of a node inside the document tree before rendering, so it would have an effect on all output formats.

The `rewriteRules` setting is of type `Seq[DocumentContext => RewriteRule]` where `RewriteRule`
is a type alias for `PartialFunction[Element,Option[Element]]`. By default this setting is empty, 
meaning Laika will only use the built-in rewrite rules like those for resolving link references.

If the partial function is not defined for a particular element the old element is kept in the tree.
If it returns `Some(Element)` this element replaces the old one.
If the function returns `None` the old element is removed from the tree.

The following (somewhat contrived, but simple) example shows how to turn each `Emphasized` node
into a `Strong` node:

    rewriteRules in Laika += rewriteRule { 
      case Emphasized(content, opts) => Some(Strong(content, opts))
    }

For more details see the chapter [Document Tree Rewriting].


### Custom Document Type Matcher

A document type matcher categorizes an input document based on its path. 
It is a function that takes a `Path` instance (from the Laika API, not `sbt.Path`)
and returns the matching `DocumentType` with valid values being one of the following
objects:

    Markup, Template, Dynamic, Static, Config, Ignored
    
These values correspond to the descriptions provided in [Document Types].

The setting is of type `Option[Path => DocumentType]` and the default is `None`, which
means that the built-in `DefaultDocumentTypeMatcher` will be used. Its naming
conventions will probably be sufficient in almost all use cases.
The matcher will only be used for inputs which make it past the `excludeFilter`.
 


Settings for Directives
-----------------------

Directives are Laika's extension hook for both, templates and text markup.
They allow to add new tag-like constructs without touching the existing parsers.

Laika supports two flavors of directives, one compatible with the reStructuredText
specification and the other with a Laika-specific syntax. 

The reStructuredText
variant is supported for full compatibility with the reStructuredText specification
and reuse of existing reStructuredText files making use of some of the standard
directives. Laika supports almost all of the directives defined in the
specification. 
Use the keys `rstSpanDirectives` or `rstBlockDirectives` for adding custom
implementations to the built-in ones.
For more details on this directive type see [Extending reStructuredText].

The Laika variant is more flexible, as it can be used in template files as well
as Markdown and reStructuredText markup. It is also somewhat simpler in syntax
and configuration while offering the same functionality. It comes with a small
set of predefined directives in this syntax. Use the keys `spanDirectives`,
`blockDirectives` or `templateDirectives` for adding custom implementations.
For more details on this directive type see [Directives][../extending-laika/directive.md:Directives].

The examples in the two chapters linked above show how to implement a directive
and register it either for use in sbt or in embedded mode.
