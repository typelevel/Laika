    * The exact mechanics of extending a theme vary depending on the type of functionality supported by themes.
    * They are roughly as follows:
    *
    * - For functionality that is an accumulation of features, for example input files, parser extensions,
    *   renderer overrides or AST rewrite rules, the effect is accumulative,
    *   this theme and the extensions will be merged to a single set of features.
    *
    * - For functionality that is provided by unique instances, for example the template engine or the default template,
    *   the effect is replacement, where the instance in the extension replaces the corresponding instance in the base,
    *   if present.
