/** A theme is a way of pre-populating the input tree with a set of templates, styles and configurations
  * to achieve a particular look & feel without the need for the user to craft their own templates,
  * CSS or JavaScript.
  *
  * Themes also allow the registration of extension bundles in case it offers custom directives, parser extensions
  * or other customizations on top of its templates and styles.
  *
  * Implementations of themes must provide an instance of the [[laika.theme.ThemeProvider]] trait to produce
  * instances of this trait.
  * The indirection is necessary as the concrete implementation of the `F[_]` effect and the thread pools for
  * execution are meant to be chosen by the user.
  *
  * Themes would also most likely come with a custom configuration API for tweaking the style and functionality
  * of the theme.
  * This is expected to be a type-safe Scala API as Laika avoids any kind of file-based, stringly configuration
  * for global settings and only uses HOCON for local configuration (per-directory, per-document, per-directive).
