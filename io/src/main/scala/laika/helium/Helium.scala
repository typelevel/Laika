/** Configuration API for the Helium theme settings.
  *
  * Helium can be fully configured with its Scala API and does not require any configuration files.
  *
  * The entry point for all configuration steps is always `Helium.defaults` to ensure there are sensible defaults
  * in place for all the options you omit in your configuration.
  *
  * For each configuration step you need to choose one of the four selectors,
  * either `all` to specify options for all three output formats or `site`, `epub` or `pdf` to select a single format.
  * Not all options are available for all formats, but the IDE's context help and the documentation below can guide you.
  *
  * In the minimal example below we only specify some metadata for all formats as well as the navigation depth
  * for EPUB and PDF:
  *
  * {{{
  * val theme = Helium.defaults
  * .all.metadata(
  * title = Some("Project Name"),
  * language = Some("de"),
  * )
  * .epub.navigationDepth(4)
  * .pdf.navigationDepth(4)
  * .build
  * }}}
  *
  * Laika also provides convenient constructors for some of the data types used frequently in its theme API.
  * You can import `laika.theme.Color._` for specifying colors with `hex("ffaaff")` or `rgb(255, 0, 0)` and
  * `laika.ast.LengthUnit._` for specifying sizes with `px(12)` or `pt(9)` or other available units.
  *
  * The final call to `build` produces a `ThemeProvider` that can be passed to Laika's transformers
  * or the `laikaTheme` sbt setting:
  *
  * Example for sbt plugin:
  * {{{
  *   laikaTheme := theme
  * }}}
  *
  * Example for the library API:
  * {{{
  * val transformer = Transformer
  *   .from(Markdown)
  *   .to(EPUB)
  *   .parallel[IO]
  *   .witTheme(theme)
  *   .build
  * }}}

    *
    * - For functionality that is an accumulation of features, for example input files, parser extensions,
    *   renderer overrides or AST rewrite rules, the effect is accumulative,
    *   this theme and the extensions will be merged to a single set of features.
    *
    * - For functionality that is provided by unique instances, for example the template engine or the default template,
