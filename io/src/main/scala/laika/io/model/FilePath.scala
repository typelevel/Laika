/** Represents an absolute path on the file system, pointing to a file or directory that may or may not exist.
  * Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the current working directory.
  * 
  * This type has a lot of shared API with the `VirtualPath` abstraction in `laika-core` via their
  * common super-trait `GenericPath`.
  * Like the virtual path API it comes with convenience methods for querying and modifying
  * suffix and fragment components, a common requirement in processing internal links for example.
  * 
  * However, it differs in three ways from the virtual path abstraction: first, semantically,
  * as the latter is never intended to represent an actual file
  * and instead just describes a tree structure of inputs (and AST documents after parsing).
  * 
  * Secondly, this type comes with additional APIs to convert to and from other path representations,
  * namely `java.io.File`, `java.nio.file.Path` and `fs2.io.file.Path`.
  *
  * And finally, the `toString` method for this type returns a platform-dependent string representation
  * by using the file separator of the underlying file system.
  * Laika's virtual path abstractions on the other hand always uses a forward slash `/` as the separator.
  * 
  * Having a dedicated file path abstraction also helps with type signatures for methods in Laika's APIs 
  * that accept two path arguments: a file path and a virtual path indicating the mount point 
  * (at which the specified file is supposed to be inserted into the virtual tree).
