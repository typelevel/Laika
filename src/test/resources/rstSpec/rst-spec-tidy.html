<p>This document is a detailed technical specification; it is not a
tutorial or a primer. If this is your first exposure to
reStructuredText, please read <a class="reference external" href=
"../../user/rst/quickstart.html">A ReStructuredText Primer</a> and

<p><a class="reference external" href=
"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> is
plaintext that uses simple and intuitive constructs to indicate the
structure of a document. These constructs are equally easy to read
in raw and processed forms. This document is itself an example of
reStructuredText (raw, if you are reading the text file, or
processed, if you are reading an HTML document, for example). The
reStructuredText parser is a component of <a class=
"reference external" href=
"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">Docutils</a> .</p>
<p>Simple, implicit markup is used to indicate special constructs,
such as section headings, bullet lists, and emphasis. The markup
used is as minimal and unobtrusive as possible. Less often-used
constructs and extensions to the basic reStructuredText syntax may
have more elaborate or explicit markup.</p>
<p>reStructuredText is applicable to documents of any length, from
the very small (such as inline program documentation fragments,
e.g. Python docstrings) to the quite large (this document).</p>
<p>The first section gives a quick overview of the syntax of the
reStructuredText markup by example. A complete specification is
given in the <a class="reference internal" href=
"#syntax-details">Syntax Details</a> section.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#literal-blocks">Literal

<h1>Quick Syntax Overview</h1>
<p>A reStructuredText document is made up of body or block-level
elements, and may be structured into sections. <a class=
"reference internal" href="#sections">Sections</a> are indicated
through title style (underlines &amp; optional overlines). Sections
contain body elements and/or subsections. Some body elements
contain further elements, such as lists containing list items,
which in turn may contain paragraphs and other body elements.
Others, such as paragraphs, contain text and <a class=
"reference internal" href="#inline-markup">inline markup</a>
elements.</p>

<div id="whitespace" class="section">
<h2>Whitespace</h2>
<p>Spaces are recommended for <a class="reference internal" href=
"#indentation">indentation</a> , but tabs may also be used. Tabs
will be converted to spaces. Tab stops are at every 8th column.</p>
<p>Other whitespace characters (form feeds [chr(12)] and vertical
tabs [chr(11)]) are converted to single spaces before
processing.</p>
<div id="blank-lines" class="section">
<h3>Blank Lines</h3>
<p>Blank lines are used to separate paragraphs and other elements.
Multiple successive blank lines are equivalent to a single blank
line, except within literal blocks (where all whitespace is
preserved). Blank lines may be omitted when the markup makes
element separation unambiguous, in conjunction with indentation.
The first line of a document is treated as if it is preceded by a
blank line, and the last line of a document is treated as if it is
followed by a blank line.</p>
</div>
<div id="indentation" class="section">
<h3>Indentation</h3>
<p>Indentation is used to indicate -- and is only significant in
indicating -- block quotes, definitions (in definition list items),
and local nested content:</p>
<ul>
<li>list item content (multi-line contents of list items, and
multiple body elements within a list item, including nested
lists),</li>
<li>the content of literal blocks, and</li>
<li>the content of explicit markup blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any text whose indentation is less than that of the current
level (i.e., unindented text or "dedents") ends the current level
of indentation.</p>
<p>Since all indentation is significant, the level of indentation
must be consistent. For example, indentation is the sole markup
indicator for <a class="reference internal" href=
"#block-quotes">block quotes</a> :</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This is a top-level paragraph.

    This paragraph belongs to a first-level block quote.

    Paragraph 2 of the first-level block quote.
</pre>
<p>Multiple levels of indentation within a block quote will result
in more complex structures:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This is a top-level paragraph.

    This paragraph belongs to a first-level block quote.

        This paragraph belongs to a second-level block quote.

Another top-level paragraph.

        This paragraph belongs to a second-level block quote.

    This paragraph belongs to a first-level block quote.  The
    second-level block quote above is inside this first-level
    block quote.
</pre>
<p>When a paragraph or other construct consists of more than one
line of text, the lines must be left-aligned:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This is a paragraph.  The lines of
this paragraph are aligned at the left.

    This paragraph has problems.  The
lines are not left-aligned.  In addition
  to potential misinterpretation, warning
    and/or error messages will be generated
  by the parser.
</pre>
<p>Several constructs begin with a marker, and the body of the
construct must be indented relative to the marker. For constructs
using simple markers (<a class="reference internal" href=
"#bullet-lists">bullet lists</a> , <a class="reference internal"
href="#enumerated-lists">enumerated lists</a> , <a class=
"reference internal" href="#footnotes">footnotes</a> , <a class=
"reference internal" href="#citations">citations</a> , <a class=
"reference internal" href="#hyperlink-targets">hyperlink
targets</a> , <a class="reference internal" href=
"#directives">directives</a> , and <a class="reference internal"
href="#comments">comments</a> ), the level of indentation of the
body is determined by the position of the first line of text, which
begins on the same line as the marker. For example, bullet list
bodies must be indented by at least two columns relative to the
left edge of the bullet:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
- This is the first line of a bullet list
  item's paragraph.  All lines must align
  relative to the first line.  [1]_

      This indented paragraph is interpreted
      as a block quote.

Because it is not sufficiently indented,
this paragraph does not belong to the list
item.

.. [1] Here's a footnote.  The second line is aligned
   with the beginning of the footnote label.  The ".."
   marker is what determines the indentation.
</pre>
<p>For constructs using complex markers (<a class=
"reference internal" href="#field-lists">field lists</a> and <a
class="reference internal" href="#option-lists">option lists</a> ),
where the marker may contain arbitrary text, the indentation of the
first line <em>after</em> the marker determines the left edge of
the body. For example, field lists may have very long markers
(containing the field names):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
:Hello: This field has a short field name, so aligning the field
        body with the first line is feasible.

:Number-of-African-swallows-required-to-carry-a-coconut: It would
    be very difficult to align the field body with the left edge
    of the first line.  It may even be preferable not to begin the
    body on the same line as the marker.
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="escaping-mechanism" class="section">
<h2>Escaping Mechanism</h2>
<p>The character set universally available to plaintext documents,
7-bit ASCII, is limited. No matter what characters are used for
markup, they will already have multiple meanings in written text.
Therefore markup characters <em>will</em> sometimes appear in text
<strong>without being intended as markup</strong> . Any serious
markup system requires an escaping mechanism to override the
default meaning of the characters used for the markup. In
reStructuredText we use the backslash, commonly used as an escaping
character in other domains.</p>
<p>A backslash followed by any character (except whitespace
characters) escapes that character. The escaped character
represents the character itself, and is prevented from playing a
role in any markup interpretation. The backslash is removed from
the output. A literal backslash is represented by two backslashes
in a row (the first backslash "escapes" the second, preventing it
being interpreted in an "escaping" role).</p>
<p>Backslash-escaped whitespace characters are removed from the
document. This allows for character-level <a class=
"reference internal" href="#inline-markup">inline markup</a> .</p>
<p>There are two contexts in which backslashes have no special
meaning: literal blocks and inline literals. In these contexts, a
single backslash represents a literal backslash, without having to
double up.</p>
<p>Please note that the reStructuredText specification and parser
do not address the issue of the representation or extraction of
text input (how and in what form the text actually <em>reaches</em>
the parser). Backslashes and other characters may serve a
character-escaping purpose in certain contexts and must be dealt
with appropriately. For example, Python uses backslashes in strings
to escape certain characters, but not others. The simplest solution
when backslashes appear in Python docstrings is to use raw
docstrings:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
r"""This is a raw docstring.  Backslashes (\) are not touched."""
</pre>
</div>
<div id="reference-names" class="section">
<h2>Reference Names</h2>
<p>Simple reference names are single words consisting of
alphanumerics plus isolated (no two adjacent) internal hyphens,
underscores, periods, colons and plus signs; no whitespace or other
characters are allowed. Footnote labels (<a class=
"reference internal" href="#footnotes">Footnotes</a> &amp; <a
class="reference internal" href="#footnote-references">Footnote
References</a> ), citation labels (<a class="reference internal"
href="#citations">Citations</a> &amp; <a class="reference internal"
href="#citation-references">Citation References</a> ), <a class=
"reference internal" href="#interpreted-text">interpreted text</a>
roles, and some <a class="reference internal" href=
"#hyperlink-references">hyperlink references</a> use the simple
reference name syntax.</p>
<p>Reference names using punctuation or whose names are phrases
(two or more space-separated words) are called "phrase-references".
Phrase-references are expressed by enclosing the phrase in
backquotes and treating the backquoted text as a reference
name:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Want to learn about `my favorite programming language`_?

.. _my favorite programming language: http://www.python.org
</pre>
<p>Simple reference names may also optionally use backquotes.</p>
<p>Reference names are whitespace-neutral and case-insensitive.
When resolving reference names internally:</p>
<ul>
<li>whitespace is normalized (one or more spaces, horizontal or
vertical tabs, newlines, carriage returns, or form feeds, are
interpreted as a single space), and</li>
<li>case is normalized (all alphabetic characters are converted to
lowercase).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following <a class="reference internal" href=
"#hyperlink-references">hyperlink references</a> are
equivalent:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
- `A HYPERLINK`_
- `a    hyperlink`_
- `A
  Hyperlink`_
</pre>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</a>
, <a class="reference internal" href="#footnotes">footnotes</a> ,
and <a class="reference internal" href="#citations">citations</a>
all share the same namespace for reference names. The labels of
citations (simple reference names) and manually-numbered footnotes
(numbers) are entered into the same database as other hyperlink
names. This means that a footnote (defined as "<tt class=
"docutils literal">.. [1]</tt> ") which can be referred to by a
footnote reference (<tt class="docutils literal">[1]_</tt> ), can
also be referred to by a plain hyperlink reference (1_). Of course,
each type of reference (hyperlink, footnote, citation) may be
processed and rendered differently. Some care should be taken to
avoid reference name conflicts.</p>
</div>
<div id="document-structure" class="section">
<h2>Document Structure</h2>
<div id="document" class="section">
<h3>Document</h3>
<p>Doctree element: document.</p>
<p>The top-level element of a parsed reStructuredText document is
the "document" element. After initial parsing, the document element
is a simple container for a document fragment, consisting of <a
class="reference internal" href="#body-elements">body elements</a>
, <a class="reference internal" href="#transitions">transitions</a>
, and <a class="reference internal" href="#sections">sections</a> ,
but lacking a document title or other bibliographic elements. The
code that calls the parser may choose to run one or more optional
post-parse <a class="reference external" href=
"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils/transforms/">transforms</a>
, rearranging the document fragment into a complete document with a
title and possibly other metadata elements (author, date, etc.; see
<a class="reference internal" href=
"#bibliographic-fields">Bibliographic Fields</a> ).</p>
<p>Specifically, there is no way to indicate a document title and
subtitle explicitly in reStructuredText. Instead, a lone top-level
section title (see <a class="reference internal" href=
"#sections">Sections</a> below) can be treated as the document
title. Similarly, a lone second-level section title immediately
after the "document title" can become the document subtitle. The
rest of the sections are then lifted up a level or two. See the <a
class="reference external" href=
"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils/transforms/frontmatter.py">DocTitle
transform</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div id="sections" class="section">
<h3>Sections</h3>
<p>Doctree elements: section, title.</p>
<p>Sections are identified through their titles, which are marked
up with adornment: "underlines" below the title text, or underlines
and matching "overlines" above the title. An underline/overline is
a single repeated punctuation character that begins in column 1 and
forms a line extending at least as far as the right edge of the
title text. Specifically, an underline/overline character may be
any non-alphanumeric printable 7-bit ASCII character <a class=
"footnote-reference" href="#1">[1]</a> . When an overline is used,
the length and character used must match the underline.
Underline-only adornment styles are distinct from
overline-and-underline styles that use the same character. There
may be any number of levels of section titles, although some output
formats may have limits (HTML has 6 levels).</p>
<table id="1" class="footnote">
<colgroup>
<col class="label">
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>[1]</td>
<td>
<p>The following are all valid section title adornment
characters:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
! " # $ % &amp; ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; &lt; = &gt; ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
</pre>
<p>Some characters are more suitable than others. The following are
recommended:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
= - ` : . ' " ~ ^ _ * + #
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Rather than imposing a fixed number and order of section title
adornment styles, the order enforced will be the order as
encountered. The first style encountered will be an outermost title
(like HTML H1), the second style will be a subtitle, the third will
be a subsubtitle, and so on.</p>
<p>Below are examples of section title styles:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

Section Title
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</pre>
<p>When a title has both an underline and an overline, the title
text may be inset, as in the first two examples above. This is
merely aesthetic and not significant. Underline-only title text may
<em>not</em> be inset.</p>
<p>A blank line after a title is optional. All text blocks up to
the next title of the same or higher level are included in a
section (or subsection, etc.).</p>
<p>All section title styles need not be used, nor need any specific
section title style be used. However, a document must be consistent
in its use of section titles: once a hierarchy of title styles is
established, sections must use that hierarchy.</p>
<p>Each section title automatically generates a hyperlink target
pointing to the section. The text of the hyperlink target (the
"reference name") is the same as that of the section title. See <a
class="reference internal" href=
"#implicit-hyperlink-targets">Implicit Hyperlink Targets</a> for a
complete description.</p>
<p>Sections may contain <a class="reference internal" href=
"#body-elements">body elements</a> , <a class="reference internal"
href="#transitions">transitions</a> , and nested sections.</p>
</div>
<div id="transitions" class="section">
<h3>Transitions</h3>
<p>Doctree element: transition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of subheads, extra space or a type ornament between
paragraphs may be used to mark text divisions or to signal changes
in subject or emphasis.</p>
<p>(The Chicago Manual of Style, 14th edition, section 1.80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transitions are commonly seen in novels and short fiction, as a
gap spanning one or more lines, with or without a type ornament
such as a row of asterisks. Transitions separate other body
elements. A transition should not begin or end a section or
document, nor should two transitions be immediately adjacent.</p>
<p>The syntax for a transition marker is a horizontal line of 4 or
more repeated punctuation characters. The syntax is the same as
section title underlines without title text. Transition markers
require blank lines before and after:</p>

</pre>
<p>Unlike section title underlines, no hierarchy of transition
markers is enforced, nor do differences in transition markers
accomplish anything. It is recommended that a single consistent
style be used.</p>
<p>The processing system is free to render transitions in output in
any way it likes. For example, horizontal rules (<tt class=
"docutils literal">&lt;hr&gt;</tt> ) in HTML output would be an
obvious choice.</p>

- The following line appears to be a new sublist, but it is not:
  - This is a paragraph continuation, not a sublist (since there's
    no blank line).  This line is also incorrectly indented.
  - Warnings may be issued by the implementation.

<h3>Enumerated Lists</h3>
<p>Doctree elements: enumerated_list, list_item.</p>
<p>Enumerated lists (a.k.a. "ordered" lists) are similar to bullet
lists, but use enumerators instead of bullets. An enumerator
consists of an enumeration sequence member and formatting, followed
by whitespace. The following enumeration sequences are
recognized:</p>
<ul>
<li>arabic numerals: 1, 2, 3, ... (no upper limit).</li>
<li>uppercase alphabet characters: A, B, C, ..., Z.</li>
<li>lower-case alphabet characters: a, b, c, ..., z.</li>
<li>uppercase Roman numerals: I, II, III, IV, ..., MMMMCMXCIX
(4999).</li>
<li>lowercase Roman numerals: i, ii, iii, iv, ..., mmmmcmxcix
(4999).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the auto-enumerator, "#", may be used to
automatically enumerate a list. Auto-enumerated lists may begin
with explicit enumeration, which sets the sequence. Fully
auto-enumerated lists use arabic numerals and begin with 1.
(Auto-enumerated lists are new in Docutils 0.3.8.)</p>
<p>The following formatting types are recognized:</p>
<ul>
<li>suffixed with a period: "1.", "A.", "a.", "I.", "i.".</li>
<li>surrounded by parentheses: "(1)", "(A)", "(a)", "(I)",
"(i)".</li>
<li>suffixed with a right-parenthesis: "1)", "A)", "a)", "I)",
"i)".</li>
</ul>
<p>While parsing an enumerated list, a new list will be started
whenever:</p>
<ul>
<li>An enumerator is encountered which does not have the same
format and sequence type as the current list (e.g. "1.", "(a)"
produces two separate lists).</li>
<li>The enumerators are not in sequence (e.g., "1.", "3." produces
two separate lists).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended that the enumerator of the first list item be
ordinal-1 ("1", "A", "a", "I", or "i"). Although other start-values
will be recognized, they may not be supported by the output format.
A level-1 [info] system message will be generated for any list
beginning with a non-ordinal-1 enumerator.</p>
<p>Lists using Roman numerals must begin with "I"/"i" or a
multi-character value, such as "II" or "XV". Any other
single-character Roman numeral ("V", "X", "L", "C", "D", "M") will
be interpreted as a letter of the alphabet, not as a Roman numeral.
Likewise, lists using letters of the alphabet may not begin with
"I"/"i", since these are recognized as Roman numeral 1.</p>
<p>The second line of each enumerated list item is checked for
validity. This is to prevent ordinary paragraphs from being
mistakenly interpreted as list items, when they happen to begin
with text identical to enumerators. For example, this text is
parsed as an ordinary paragraph:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
A. Einstein was a really
smart dude.
</pre>
<p>However, ambiguity cannot be avoided if the paragraph consists
of only one line. This text is parsed as an enumerated list
item:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
A. Einstein was a really smart dude.
</pre>
<p>If a single-line paragraph begins with text identical to an
enumerator ("A.", "1.", "(b)", "I)", etc.), the first character
will have to be escaped in order to have the line parsed as an
ordinary paragraph:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
\A. Einstein was a really smart dude.
</pre>
<p>Examples of nested enumerated lists:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
1. Item 1 initial text.

   a) Item 1a.
   b) Item 1b.

2. a) Item 2a.
   b) Item 2b.

<h3>Definition Lists</h3>
<p>Doctree elements: definition_list, definition_list_item, term,
classifier, definition.</p>
<p>Each definition list item contains a term, optional classifiers,
and a definition. A term is a simple one-line word or phrase.
Optional classifiers may follow the term on the same line, each
after an inline " : " (space, colon, space). A definition is a
block indented relative to the term, and may contain multiple
paragraphs and other body elements. There may be no blank line
between a term line and a definition block (this distinguishes
definition lists from <a class="reference internal" href=
"#block-quotes">block quotes</a> ). Blank lines are required before
the first and after the last definition list item, but are optional
in-between. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
term 1
    Definition 1.

term 2
    Definition 2, paragraph 1.

    Definition 2, paragraph 2.

term 3 : classifier
    Definition 3.

term 4 : classifier one : classifier two
    Definition 4.
</pre>
<p>Inline markup is parsed in the term line before the classifier
delimiter (" : ") is recognized. The delimiter will only be
recognized if it appears outside of any inline markup.</p>
<p>A definition list may be used in various ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a dictionary or glossary. The term is the word itself, a
classifier may be used to indicate the usage of the term (noun,
verb, etc.), and the definition follows.</li>
<li>To describe program variables. The term is the variable name, a
classifier may be used to indicate the type of the variable
(string, integer, etc.), and the definition describes the
variable's use in the program. This usage of definition lists
supports the classifier syntax of <a class="reference external"
href="http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/grouch/">Grouch</a> , a
system for describing and enforcing a Python object schema.</li>

<div id="field-lists" class="section">
<h3>Field Lists</h3>
<p>Doctree elements: field_list, field, field_name, field_body.</p>
<p>Field lists are used as part of an extension syntax, such as
options for <a class="reference internal" href=
"#directives">directives</a> , or database-like records meant for
further processing. They may also be used for two-column table-like
structures resembling database records (label &amp; data pairs).
Applications of reStructuredText may recognize field names and
transform fields or field bodies in certain contexts. For examples,
see <a class="reference internal" href=
"#bibliographic-fields">Bibliographic Fields</a> below, or the "<a
class="reference external" href="directives.html#image">image</a> "
and "<a class="reference external" href=
"directives.html#meta">meta</a> " directives in <a class=
"reference external" href="directives.html">reStructuredText
Directives</a> .</p>
<p>Field lists are mappings from field names to field bodies,
modeled on <a class="reference external" href=
"http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</a> headers. A
field name may consist of any characters, but colons (":") inside
of field names must be escaped with a backslash. Inline markup is
parsed in field names. Field names are case-insensitive when
further processed or transformed. The field name, along with a
single colon prefix and suffix, together form the field marker. The
field marker is followed by whitespace and the field body. The
field body may contain multiple body elements, indented relative to
the field marker. The first line after the field name marker
determines the indentation of the field body. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
:Date: 2001-08-16
:Version: 1
:Authors: - Me
          - Myself
          - I
:Indentation: Since the field marker may be quite long, the second
   and subsequent lines of the field body do not have to line up
   with the first line, but they must be indented relative to the
   field name marker, and they must line up with each other.
:Parameter i: integer
</pre>
<p>The interpretation of individual words in a multi-word field
name is up to the application. The application may specify a syntax
for the field name. For example, second and subsequent words may be
treated as "arguments", quoted phrases may be treated as a single
argument, and direct support for the "name=value" syntax may be
added.</p>
<p>Standard <a class="reference external" href=
"http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</a> headers
cannot be used for this construct because they are ambiguous. A
word followed by a colon at the beginning of a line is common in
written text. However, in well-defined contexts such as when a
field list invariably occurs at the beginning of a document (PEPs
and email messages), standard RFC822 headers could be used.</p>

<h4>Bibliographic Fields</h4>
<p>Doctree elements: docinfo, author, authors, organization,
contact, version, status, date, copyright, field, topic.</p>
<p>When a field list is the first non-comment element in a document
(after the document title, if there is one), it may have its fields
transformed to document bibliographic data. This bibliographic data
corresponds to the front matter of a book, such as the title page
and copyright page.</p>
<p>Certain registered field names (listed below) are recognized and
transformed to the corresponding doctree elements, most becoming
child elements of the "docinfo" element. No ordering is required of
these fields, although they may be rearranged to fit the document
structure, as noted. Unless otherwise indicated below, each of the
bibliographic elements' field bodies may contain a single paragraph
only. Field bodies may be checked for <a class="reference internal"
href="#rcs-keywords">RCS keywords</a> and cleaned up. Any
unrecognized fields will remain as generic fields in the docinfo
element.</p>
<p>The registered bibliographic field names and their corresponding
doctree elements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Field name "Author": author element.</li>
<li>"Authors": authors.</li>
<li>"Organization": organization.</li>
<li>"Contact": contact.</li>
<li>"Address": address.</li>
<li>"Version": version.</li>
<li>"Status": status.</li>
<li>"Date": date.</li>
<li>"Copyright": copyright.</li>
<li>"Dedication": topic.</li>
<li>"Abstract": topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "Authors" field may contain either: a single paragraph
consisting of a list of authors, separated by ";" or ","; or a
bullet list whose elements each contain a single paragraph per
author. ";" is checked first, so "Doe, Jane; Doe, John" will work.
In some languages (e.g. Swedish), there is no singular/plural
distinction between "Author" and "Authors", so only an "Authors"
field is provided, and a single name is interpreted as an "Author".
If a single name contains a comma, end it with a semicolon to
disambiguate: ":Authors: Doe, Jane;".</p>
<p>The "Address" field is for a multi-line surface mailing address.
Newlines and whitespace will be preserved.</p>
<p>The "Dedication" and "Abstract" fields may contain arbitrary
body elements. Only one of each is allowed. They become topic
elements with "Dedication" or "Abstract" titles (or language
equivalents) immediately following the docinfo element.</p>
<p>This field-name-to-element mapping can be replaced for other
languages. See the <a class="reference external" href=
"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils/transforms/frontmatter.py">DocInfo
transform</a> implementation documentation for details.</p>
<p>Unregistered/generic fields may contain one or more paragraphs

entered into source files as "$keyword$", and once stored under RCS

<h3>Option Lists</h3>
<p>Doctree elements: option_list, option_list_item, option_group,
option, option_string, option_argument, description.</p>
<p>Option lists are two-column lists of command-line options and
descriptions, documenting a program's options. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
-a         Output all.
-b         Output both (this description is
           quite long).
-c arg     Output just arg.
--long     Output all day long.

-p         This option has two paragraphs in the description.
           This is the first.

           This is the second.  Blank lines may be omitted between
           options (as above) or left in (as here and below).

--very-long-option  A VMS-style option.  Note the adjustment for
                    the required two spaces.

--an-even-longer-option
           The description can also start on the next line.

-2, --two  This option has two variants.

-f FILE, --file=FILE  These two options are synonyms; both have
                      arguments.

/V         A VMS/DOS-style option.
</pre>
<p>There are several types of options recognized by
reStructuredText:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short POSIX options consist of one dash and an option
letter.</li>
<li>Long POSIX options consist of two dashes and an option word;
some systems use a single dash.</li>
<li>Old GNU-style "plus" options consist of one plus and an option
letter ("plus" options are deprecated now, their use
discouraged).</li>
<li>DOS/VMS options consist of a slash and an option letter or
word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that both POSIX-style and DOS/VMS-style options may
be used by DOS or Windows software. These and other variations are
sometimes used mixed together. The names above have been chosen for
convenience only.</p>
<p>The syntax for short and long POSIX options is based on the
syntax supported by Python's <a class="reference external" href=
"http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-getopt.html">getopt.py</a>
module, which implements an option parser similar to the <a class=
"reference external" href=
"http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt-Long-Options.html">GNU
libc getopt_long()</a> function but with some restrictions. There
are many variant option systems, and reStructuredText option lists
do not support all of them.</p>
<p>Although long POSIX and DOS/VMS option words may be allowed to
be truncated by the operating system or the application when used
on the command line, reStructuredText option lists do not show or
support this with any special syntax. The complete option word
should be given, supported by notes about truncation if and when
applicable.</p>
<p>Options may be followed by an argument placeholder, whose role
and syntax should be explained in the description text. Either a
space or an equals sign may be used as a delimiter between options
and option argument placeholders; short options ("-" or "+" prefix
only) may omit the delimiter. Option arguments may take one of two
forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Begins with a letter (<tt class=
"docutils literal">[a-zA-Z]</tt> ) and subsequently consists of
letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens (<tt class=
"docutils literal">[a-zA-Z0-9_-]</tt> ).</li>
<li>Begins with an open-angle-bracket (<tt class=
"docutils literal">&lt;</tt> ) and ends with a close-angle-bracket
(<tt class="docutils literal">&gt;</tt> ); any characters except
angle brackets are allowed internally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple option "synonyms" may be listed, sharing a single
description. They must be separated by comma-space.</p>
<p>There must be at least two spaces between the option(s) and the
description. The description may contain multiple body elements.
The first line after the option marker determines the indentation
of the description. As with other types of lists, blank lines are
required before the first option list item and after the last, but
are optional between option entries.</p>

<h3>Literal Blocks</h3>
<p>Doctree element: literal_block.</p>
<p>A paragraph consisting of two colons ("::") signifies that the
following text block(s) comprise a literal block. The literal block
must either be indented or quoted (see below). No markup processing
is done within a literal block. It is left as-is, and is typically
rendered in a monospaced typeface:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This is a typical paragraph.  An indented literal block follows.

::

    for a in [5,4,3,2,1]:   # this is program code, shown as-is
        print a
    print "it's..."
    # a literal block continues until the indentation ends

This text has returned to the indentation of the first paragraph,
is outside of the literal block, and is therefore treated as an
ordinary paragraph.
</pre>
<p>The paragraph containing only "::" will be completely removed
from the output; no empty paragraph will remain.</p>
<p>As a convenience, the "::" is recognized at the end of any
paragraph. If immediately preceded by whitespace, both colons will
be removed from the output (this is the "partially minimized"
form). When text immediately precedes the "::", <em>one</em> colon
will be removed from the output, leaving only one colon visible
(i.e., "::" will be replaced by ":"; this is the "fully minimized"
form).</p>
<p>In other words, these are all equivalent (please pay attention
to the colons after "Paragraph"):</p>

<p>All whitespace (including line breaks, but excluding minimum
indentation for indented literal blocks) is preserved. Blank lines
are required before and after a literal block, but these blank
lines are not included as part of the literal block.</p>
<div id="indented-literal-blocks" class="section">

<h3>Line Blocks</h3>
<p>Doctree elements: line_block, line. (New in Docutils 0.3.5.)</p>
<p>Line blocks are useful for address blocks, verse (poetry, song
lyrics), and unadorned lists, where the structure of lines is
significant. Line blocks are groups of lines beginning with
vertical bar ("|") prefixes. Each vertical bar prefix indicates a
new line, so line breaks are preserved. Initial indents are also
significant, resulting in a nested structure. Inline markup is
supported. Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar. The left edge
of a continuation line must be indented, but need not be aligned
with the left edge of the text above it. A line block ends with a
blank line.</p>
<p>This example illustrates continuation lines:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
| Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday.
| I'm absolutely skint.
| But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back
  as soon as it comes.
| Love, Ewan.

by the initial indentation of new lines:</p>

<h3>Doctest Blocks</h3>
<p>Doctree element: doctest_block.</p>
<p>Doctest blocks are interactive Python sessions cut-and-pasted
into docstrings. They are meant to illustrate usage by example, and
provide an elegant and powerful testing environment via the <a
class="reference external" href=
"http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html">doctest
module</a> in the Python standard library.</p>
<p>Doctest blocks are text blocks which begin with <tt class=
"docutils literal">"&gt;&gt;&gt; "</tt> , the Python interactive
interpreter main prompt, and end with a blank line. Doctest blocks
are treated as a special case of literal blocks, without requiring
the literal block syntax. If both are present, the literal block
syntax takes priority over Doctest block syntax:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This is an ordinary paragraph.

&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'this is a Doctest block'
this is a Doctest block

The following is a literal block::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; This is not recognized as a doctest block by
    reStructuredText.  It *will* be recognized by the doctest
    module, though!
</pre>
<p>Indentation is not required for doctest blocks.</p>
</div>
<div id="tables" class="section">
<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>Doctree elements: table, tgroup, colspec, thead, tbody, row,
entry.</p>
<p>ReStructuredText provides two syntaxes for delineating table
cells: <a class="reference internal" href="#grid-tables">Grid
Tables</a> and <a class="reference internal" href=
"#simple-tables">Simple Tables</a> .</p>
<p>As with other body elements, blank lines are required before and
after tables. Tables' left edges should align with the left edge of
preceding text blocks; if indented, the table is considered to be
part of a block quote.</p>
<p>Once isolated, each table cell is treated as a miniature
document; the top and bottom cell boundaries act as delimiting
blank lines. Each cell contains zero or more body elements. Cell
contents may include left and/or right margins, which are removed
before processing.</p>
<div id="grid-tables" class="section">
<h4>Grid Tables</h4>
<p>Grid tables provide a complete table representation via
grid-like "ASCII art". Grid tables allow arbitrary cell contents
(body elements), and both row and column spans. However, grid
tables can be cumbersome to produce, especially for simple data
sets. The <a class="reference external" href=
"http://table.sourceforge.net/">Emacs table mode</a> is a tool that
allows easy editing of grid tables, in Emacs. See <a class=
"reference internal" href="#simple-tables">Simple Tables</a> for a
simpler (but limited) representation.</p>
<p>Grid tables are described with a visual grid made up of the
characters "-", "=", "|", and "+". The hyphen ("-") is used for
horizontal lines (row separators). The equals sign ("=") may be
used to separate optional header rows from the table body (not
supported by the <a class="reference external" href=
"http://table.sourceforge.net/">Emacs table mode</a> ). The
vertical bar ("|") is used for vertical lines (column separators).
The plus sign ("+") is used for intersections of horizontal and
vertical lines. Example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
| Header row, column 1   | Header 2   | Header 3 | Header 4 |
| (header rows optional) |            |          |          |
+========================+============+==========+==========+
| body row 1, column 1   | column 2   | column 3 | column 4 |
+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
| body row 2             | Cells may span columns.          |
+------------------------+------------+---------------------+
| body row 3             | Cells may  | - Table cells       |
+------------------------+ span rows. | - contain           |
| body row 4             |            | - body elements.    |
+------------------------+------------+---------------------+
</pre>
<p>Some care must be taken with grid tables to avoid undesired
interactions with cell text in rare cases. For example, the
following table contains a cell in row 2 spanning from column 2 to
column 4:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 1, col 1 | column 2 | column 3  | column 4  |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 2        |                                  |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 3        |          |           |           |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
</pre>
<p>If a vertical bar is used in the text of that cell, it could
have unintended effects if accidentally aligned with column
boundaries:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 1, col 1 | column 2 | column 3  | column 4  |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 2        | Use the command ``ls | more``.   |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 3        |          |           |           |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
</pre>
<p>Several solutions are possible. All that is needed is to break
the continuity of the cell outline rectangle. One possibility is to
shift the text by adding an extra space before:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 1, col 1 | column 2 | column 3  | column 4  |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 2        |  Use the command ``ls | more``.  |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 3        |          |           |           |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
</pre>
<p>Another possibility is to add an extra line to row 2:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 1, col 1 | column 2 | column 3  | column 4  |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 2        | Use the command ``ls | more``.   |
|              |                                  |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
| row 3        |          |           |           |
+--------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
</pre>
</div>
<div id="simple-tables" class="section">
<h4>Simple Tables</h4>
<p>Simple tables provide a compact and easy to type but limited
row-oriented table representation for simple data sets. Cell
contents are typically single paragraphs, although arbitrary body
elements may be represented in most cells. Simple tables allow
multi-line rows (in all but the first column) and column spans, but
not row spans. See <a class="reference internal" href=
"#grid-tables">Grid Tables</a> above for a complete table
representation.</p>
<p>Simple tables are described with horizontal borders made up of
"=" and "-" characters. The equals sign ("=") is used for top and
bottom table borders, and to separate optional header rows from the
table body. The hyphen ("-") is used to indicate column spans in a
single row by underlining the joined columns, and may optionally be
used to explicitly and/or visually separate rows.</p>
<p>A simple table begins with a top border of equals signs with one
or more spaces at each column boundary (two or more spaces
recommended). Regardless of spans, the top border <em>must</em>
fully describe all table columns. There must be at least two
columns in the table (to differentiate it from section headers).
The top border may be followed by header rows, and the last of the
optional header rows is underlined with '=', again with spaces at
column boundaries. There may not be a blank line below the header
row separator; it would be interpreted as the bottom border of the
table. The bottom boundary of the table consists of '=' underlines,
also with spaces at column boundaries. For example, here is a truth
table, a three-column table with one header row and four body
rows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
=====  =====  =======
  A      B    A and B
=====  =====  =======
False  False  False
True   False  False
False  True   False
True   True   True
=====  =====  =======
</pre>
<p>Underlines of '-' may be used to indicate column spans by
"filling in" column margins to join adjacent columns. Column span
underlines must be complete (they must cover all columns) and align
with established column boundaries. Text lines containing column
span underlines may not contain any other text. A column span
underline applies only to one row immediately above it. For
example, here is a table with a column span in the header:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
=====  =====  ======
   Inputs     Output
------------  ------
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False  False  False
True   False  True
False  True   True
True   True   True
=====  =====  ======
</pre>
<p>Each line of text must contain spaces at column boundaries,
except where cells have been joined by column spans. Each line of
text starts a new row, except when there is a blank cell in the
first column. In that case, that line of text is parsed as a
continuation line. For this reason, cells in the first column of
new rows (<em>not</em> continuation lines) <em>must</em> contain
some text; blank cells would lead to a misinterpretation (but see
the tip below). Also, this mechanism limits cells in the first
column to only one line of text. Use <a class="reference internal"
href="#grid-tables">grid tables</a> if this limitation is
unacceptable.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>To start a new row in a simple table without text in the first
column in the processed output, use one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>an empty comment (".."), which may be omitted from the
processed output (see <a class="reference internal" href=
"#comments">Comments</a> below)</li>
<li>a backslash escape ("<tt class="docutils literal">\</tt> ")
followed by a space (see <a class="reference internal" href=
"#escaping-mechanism">Escaping Mechanism</a> above)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Underlines of '-' may also be used to visually separate rows,
even if there are no column spans. This is especially useful in
long tables, where rows are many lines long.</p>
<p>Blank lines are permitted within simple tables. Their
interpretation depends on the context. Blank lines <em>between</em>
rows are ignored. Blank lines <em>within</em> multi-line rows may
separate paragraphs or other body elements within cells.</p>
<p>The rightmost column is unbounded; text may continue past the
edge of the table (as indicated by the table borders). However, it
is recommended that borders be made long enough to contain the
entire text.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates continuation lines (row 2
consists of two lines of text, and four lines for row 3), a blank
line separating paragraphs (row 3, column 2), text extending past
the right edge of the table, and a new row which will have no text
in the first column in the processed output (row 4):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
=====  =====
col 1  col 2
=====  =====
1      Second column of row 1.
2      Second column of row 2.
       Second line of paragraph.
3      - Second column of row 3.

       - Second item in bullet
         list (row 3, column 2).
\      Row 4; column 1 will be empty.
=====  =====

<div id="explicit-markup-blocks" class="section">
<h3>Explicit Markup Blocks</h3>
<p>An explicit markup block is a text block:</p>
<ul>
<li>whose first line begins with ".." followed by whitespace (the
"explicit markup start"),</li>
<li>whose second and subsequent lines (if any) are indented
relative to the first, and</li>
<li>which ends before an unindented line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explicit markup blocks are analogous to bullet list items, with
".." as the bullet. The text on the lines immediately after the
explicit markup start determines the indentation of the block body.
The maximum common indentation is always removed from the second
and subsequent lines of the block body. Therefore if the first
construct fits in one line, and the indentation of the first and
second constructs should differ, the first construct should not
begin on the same line as the explicit markup start.</p>
<p>Blank lines are required between explicit markup blocks and
other elements, but are optional between explicit markup blocks
where unambiguous.</p>
<p>The explicit markup syntax is used for footnotes, citations,
hyperlink targets, directives, substitution definitions, and
comments.</p>
<div id="footnotes" class="section">
<h4>Footnotes</h4>
<p>Doctree elements: footnote, label.</p>
<p>Each footnote consists of an explicit markup start (".. "), a
left square bracket, the footnote label, a right square bracket,
and whitespace, followed by indented body elements. A footnote
label can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a whole decimal number consisting of one or more digits,</li>
<li>a single "#" (denoting <a class="reference internal" href=
"#auto-numbered-footnotes">auto-numbered footnotes</a> ),</li>
<li>a "#" followed by a simple reference name (an <a class=
"reference internal" href="#autonumber-labels">autonumber label</a>
), or</li>
<li>a single "*" (denoting <a class="reference internal" href=
"#auto-symbol-footnotes">auto-symbol footnotes</a> ).</li>
</ul>
<p>The footnote content (body elements) must be consistently
indented (by at least 3 spaces) and left-aligned. The first body
element within a footnote may often begin on the same line as the
footnote label. However, if the first element fits on one line and
the indentation of the remaining elements differ, the first element
must begin on the line after the footnote label. Otherwise, the
difference in indentation will not be detected.</p>
<p>Footnotes may occur anywhere in the document, not only at the
end. Where and how they appear in the processed output depends on
the processing system.</p>
<p>Here is a manually numbered footnote:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. [1] Body elements go here.
</pre>
<p>Each footnote automatically generates a hyperlink target
pointing to itself. The text of the hyperlink target name is the
same as that of the footnote label. <a class="reference internal"
href="#auto-numbered-footnotes">Auto-numbered footnotes</a>
generate a number as their footnote label and reference name. See
<a class="reference internal" href=

<div id="auto-numbered-footnotes" class="section">
<h5>Auto-Numbered Footnotes</h5>
<p>A number sign ("#") may be used as the first character of a
footnote label to request automatic numbering of the footnote or
footnote reference.</p>
<p>The first footnote to request automatic numbering is assigned
the label "1", the second is assigned the label "2", and so on
(assuming there are no manually numbered footnotes present; see <a
class="reference internal" href=
"#mixed-manual-and-auto-numbered-footnotes">Mixed Manual and
Auto-Numbered Footnotes</a> below). A footnote which has
automatically received a label "1" generates an implicit hyperlink
target with name "1", just as if the label was explicitly
specified.</p>
<p>A footnote may specify a label explicitly while at the same time
requesting automatic numbering: <tt class=
"docutils literal">[#label]</tt> . These labels are called <span
id="autonumber-labels" class="target">autonumber labels</span> .
Autonumber labels do two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the footnote itself, they generate a hyperlink target whose
name is the autonumber label (doesn't include the "#").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They allow an automatically numbered footnote to be referred to
more than once, as a footnote reference or hyperlink reference. For
example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
If [#note]_ is the first footnote reference, it will show up as
"[1]".  We can refer to it again as [#note]_ and again see
"[1]".  We can also refer to it as note_ (an ordinary internal
hyperlink reference).

.. [#note] This is the footnote labeled "note".
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The numbering is determined by the order of the footnotes, not
by the order of the references. For footnote references without
autonumber labels (<tt class="docutils literal">[#]_</tt> ), the
footnotes and footnote references must be in the same relative
order but need not alternate in lock-step. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[#]_ is a reference to footnote 1, and [#]_ is a reference to
footnote 2.

.. [#] This is footnote 1.
.. [#] This is footnote 2.
.. [#] This is footnote 3.

[#]_ is a reference to footnote 3.
</pre>
<p>Special care must be taken if footnotes themselves contain
auto-numbered footnote references, or if multiple references are
made in close proximity. Footnotes and references are noted in the
order they are encountered in the document, which is not
necessarily the same as the order in which a person would read
them.</p>
</div>
<div id="auto-symbol-footnotes" class="section">
<h5>Auto-Symbol Footnotes</h5>
<p>An asterisk ("*") may be used for footnote labels to request
automatic symbol generation for footnotes and footnote references.
The asterisk may be the only character in the label. For
example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Here is a symbolic footnote reference: [*]_.

.. [*] This is the footnote.
</pre>
<p>A transform will insert symbols as labels into corresponding
footnotes and footnote references. The number of references must be
equal to the number of footnotes. One symbol footnote cannot have
multiple references.</p>
<p>The standard Docutils system uses the following symbols for
footnote marks <a class="footnote-reference" href="#6">[6]</a>
:</p>
<ul>
<li>asterisk/star ("*")</li>
<li>dagger (HTML character entity "&amp;dagger;", Unicode

<p>When using auto-symbol footnotes, the choice of output encoding
is important. Many of the symbols used are not encodable in certain
common text encodings such as Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1). The use of
UTF-8 for the output encoding is recommended. An alternative for
HTML and XML output is to use the "xmlcharrefreplace" <a class=

<h5>Mixed Manual and Auto-Numbered Footnotes</h5>
<p>Manual and automatic footnote numbering may both be used within
a single document, although the results may not be expected. Manual
numbering takes priority. Only unused footnote numbers are assigned
to auto-numbered footnotes. The following example should be
illustrative:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[2]_ will be "2" (manually numbered),
[#]_ will be "3" (anonymous auto-numbered), and
[#label]_ will be "1" (labeled auto-numbered).

.. [#label] This autonumber-labeled footnote will be labeled "1".
   It is the first auto-numbered footnote and no other footnote
   with label "1" exists.  The order of the footnotes is used to
   determine numbering, not the order of the footnote references.

<p>Hyperlink targets may be named or anonymous. Named hyperlink

and a link block:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>Reference names are whitespace-neutral and case-insensitive. See

<p>An alternate syntax for anonymous hyperlinks consists of two

__ anonymous-hyperlink-target-link-block
</pre>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href=
"#anonymous-hyperlinks">Anonymous Hyperlinks</a> below.</p>
<p>There are three types of hyperlink targets: internal, external,
and indirect.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><span id="internal-hyperlink-targets" class="target">Internal
hyperlink targets</span> have empty link blocks. They provide an
end point allowing a hyperlink to connect one place to another
within a document. An internal hyperlink target points to the
element following the target. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Clicking on this internal hyperlink will take us to the target_
below.

.. _target:

The hyperlink target above points to this paragraph.
</pre>
<p>Internal hyperlink targets may be "chained". Multiple adjacent
internal hyperlink targets all point to the same element:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. _target1:
.. _target2:

The targets "target1" and "target2" are synonyms; they both
point to this paragraph.
</pre>
<p>If the element "pointed to" is an external hyperlink target
(with a URI in its link block; see #2 below) the URI from the
external hyperlink target is propagated to the internal hyperlink
targets; they will all "point to" the same URI. There is no need to
duplicate a URI. For example, all three of the following hyperlink
targets refer to the same URI:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. _Python DOC-SIG mailing list archive:
.. _archive:
.. _Doc-SIG: http://mail.python.org/pipermail/doc-sig/

Internal Targets</a> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span id="external-hyperlink-targets" class="target">External
hyperlink targets</span> have an absolute or relative URI or email
address in their link blocks. For example, take the following
input:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

`Write to me`_ with your questions.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org
.. _Write to me: jdoe@example.com

for info.

&lt;a href="mailto:jdoe@example.com"&gt;Write to me&lt;/a&gt; with your
questions.
</pre>
<p>An external hyperlink's URI may begin on the same line as the
explicit markup start and target name, or it may begin in an
indented text block immediately following, with no intervening
blank lines. If there are multiple lines in the link block, they
are concatenated. Any whitespace is removed (whitespace is
permitted to allow for line wrapping). The following external
hyperlink targets are equivalent:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

.. _starts-on-this-line: http://
   docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

.. _entirely-below:

<p>If an external hyperlink target's URI contains an underscore as
its last character, it must be escaped to avoid being mistaken for
an indirect hyperlink target:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p><span id="indirect-hyperlink-targets" class="target">Indirect
hyperlink targets</span> have a hyperlink reference in their link
blocks. In the following example, target "one" indirectly
references whatever target "two" references, and target "two"
references target "three", an internal hyperlink target. In effect,
all three reference the same thing:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. _one: two_
.. _two: three_
.. _three:
</pre>
<p>Just as with <a class="reference internal" href=
"#hyperlink-references">hyperlink references</a> anywhere else in a
document, if a phrase-reference is used in the link block it must
be enclosed in backquotes. As with <a class="reference internal"
href="#external-hyperlink-targets">external hyperlink targets</a> ,
the link block of an indirect hyperlink target may begin on the
same line as the explicit markup start or the next line. It may
also be split over multiple lines, in which case the lines are
joined with whitespace before being normalized.</p>
<p>For example, the following indirect hyperlink targets are
equivalent:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. _one-liner: `A HYPERLINK`_
.. _entirely-below:
   `a    hyperlink`_
.. _split: `A
   Hyperlink`_
</pre>
<p>It is possible to include an alias directly within hyperlink
references. See <a class="reference internal" href=
"#embedded-uris-and-aliases">Embedded URIs and Aliases</a>
below.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the reference name contains any colons, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the phrase must be enclosed in backquotes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. _`FAQTS: Computers: Programming: Languages: Python`:
   http://python.faqts.com/
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>or the colon(s) must be backslash-escaped in the link
target:</p>

<h5>Anonymous Hyperlinks</h5>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href=
"http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> recommends in
its <a class="reference external" href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#link-text">HTML Techniques
for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> that authors should
"clearly identify the target of each link." Hyperlink references
should be as verbose as possible, but duplicating a verbose
hyperlink name in the target is onerous and error-prone. Anonymous
hyperlinks are designed to allow convenient verbose hyperlink
references, and are analogous to <a class="reference internal"
href="#auto-numbered-footnotes">Auto-Numbered Footnotes</a> . They
are particularly useful in short or one-off documents. However,
this feature is easily abused and can result in unreadable
plaintext and/or unmaintainable documents. Caution is advised.</p>
<p>Anonymous <a class="reference internal" href=
"#hyperlink-references">hyperlink references</a> are specified with
two underscores instead of one:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
See `the web site of my favorite programming language`__.
</pre>
<p>Anonymous targets begin with ".. __:"; no reference name is
required or allowed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. __: http://www.python.org
</pre>
<p>As a convenient alternative, anonymous targets may begin with
"__" only:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
__ http://www.python.org
</pre>
<p>The reference name of the reference is not used to match the
reference to its target. Instead, the order of anonymous hyperlink
references and targets within the document is significant: the
first anonymous reference will link to the first anonymous target.
The number of anonymous hyperlink references in a document must
match the number of anonymous targets. For readability, it is
recommended that targets be kept close to references. Take care
when editing text containing anonymous references; adding,
removing, and rearranging references require attention to the order
of corresponding targets.</p>

<div id="directives" class="section">
<h4>Directives</h4>
<p>Doctree elements: depend on the directive.</p>
<p>Directives are an extension mechanism for reStructuredText, a
way of adding support for new constructs without adding new primary
syntax (directives may support additional syntax locally). All
standard directives (those implemented and registered in the
reference reStructuredText parser) are described in the <a class=
"reference external" href="directives.html">reStructuredText
Directives</a> document, and are always available. Any other
directives are domain-specific, and may require special action to
make them available when processing the document.</p>
<p>For example, here's how an <a class="reference external" href=
"directives.html#image">image</a> may be placed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. image:: mylogo.jpeg
</pre>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href=
"directives.html#figure">figure</a> (a graphic with a caption) may
placed like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. figure:: larch.png

   The larch.
</pre>
<p>An <a class="reference external" href=
"directives.html#admonitions">admonition</a> (note, caution, etc.)
contains other body elements:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. note:: This is a paragraph

   - Here is a bullet list.
</pre>
<p>Directives are indicated by an explicit markup start (".. ")
followed by the directive type, two colons, and whitespace
(together called the "directive marker"). Directive types are
case-insensitive single words (alphanumerics plus isolated internal
hyphens, underscores, plus signs, colons, and periods; no
whitespace). Two colons are used after the directive type for these
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two colons are distinctive, and unlikely to be used in common
text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two colons avoids clashes with common comment text like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. Danger: modify at your own risk!
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an implementation of reStructuredText does not recognize a
directive (i.e., the directive-handler is not installed), a level-3
(error) system message is generated, and the entire directive block
(including the directive itself) will be included as a literal
block. Thus "::" is a natural choice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The directive block is consists of any text on the first line of
the directive after the directive marker, and any subsequent
indented text. The interpretation of the directive block is up to
the directive code. There are three logical parts to the directive
block:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>Directive arguments.</li>
<li>Directive options.</li>
<li>Directive content.</li>
</ol>
<p>Individual directives can employ any combination of these parts.
Directive arguments can be filesystem paths, URLs, title text, etc.
Directive options are indicated using <a class="reference internal"
href="#field-lists">field lists</a> ; the field names and contents
are directive-specific. Arguments and options must form a
contiguous block beginning on the first or second line of the
directive; a blank line indicates the beginning of the directive
content block. If either arguments and/or options are employed by
the directive, a blank line must separate them from the directive
content. The "figure" directive employs all three parts:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. figure:: larch.png
   :scale: 50

   The larch.
</pre>
<p>Simple directives may not require any content. If a directive
that does not employ a content block is followed by indented text
anyway, it is an error. If a block quote should immediately follow
a directive, use an empty comment in-between (see <a class=
"reference internal" href="#comments">Comments</a> below).</p>
<p>Actions taken in response to directives and the interpretation
of text in the directive content block or subsequent text block(s)
are directive-dependent. See <a class="reference external" href=
"directives.html">reStructuredText Directives</a> for details.</p>
<p>Directives are meant for the arbitrary processing of their
contents, which can be transformed into something possibly
unrelated to the original text. It may also be possible for
directives to be used as pragmas, to modify the behavior of the
parser, such as to experiment with alternate syntax. There is no
parser support for this functionality at present; if a reasonable
need for pragma directives is found, they may be supported.</p>
<p>Directives do not generate "directive" elements; they are a
<em>parser construct</em> only, and have no intrinsic meaning
outside of reStructuredText. Instead, the parser will transform
recognized directives into (possibly specialized) document
elements. Unknown directives will trigger level-3 (error) system
messages.</p>

<div id="substitution-definitions" class="section">
<h4>Substitution Definitions</h4>
<p>Doctree element: substitution_definition.</p>
<p>Substitution definitions are indicated by an explicit markup
start (".. ") followed by a vertical bar, the substitution text,
another vertical bar, whitespace, and the definition block.
Substitution text may not begin or end with whitespace. A
substitution definition block contains an embedded
inline-compatible directive (without the leading ".. "), such as
"<a class="reference external" href=
"directives.html#image">image</a> " or "<a class=
"reference external" href="directives.html#replace">replace</a> ".
For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
The |biohazard| symbol must be used on containers used to
dispose of medical waste.

.. |biohazard| image:: biohazard.png
</pre>
<p>It is an error for a substitution definition block to directly
or indirectly contain a circular substitution reference.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href=
"#substitution-references">Substitution references</a> are replaced
in-line by the processed contents of the corresponding definition
(linked by matching substitution text). Matches are case-sensitive
but forgiving; if no exact match is found, a case-insensitive
comparison is attempted.</p>
<p>Substitution definitions allow the power and flexibility of
block-level <a class="reference internal" href=
"#directives">directives</a> to be shared by inline text. They are
a way to include arbitrarily complex inline structures within text,
while keeping the details out of the flow of text. They are the
equivalent of SGML/XML's named entities or programming language
macros.</p>
<p>Without the substitution mechanism, every time someone wants an
application-specific new inline structure, they would have to
petition for a syntax change. In combination with existing
directive syntax, any inline structure can be coded without new
syntax (except possibly a new directive).</p>
<p>Syntax diagram:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
+-------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| ".. " | "|" substitution text "| " directive type "::" data |
+-------+ directive block                                     |
        |                                                     |
        +-----------------------------------------------------+
</pre>
<p>Following are some use cases for the substitution mechanism.
Please note that most of the embedded directives shown are examples
only and have not been implemented.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Objects</dt>
<dd>
<p>Substitution references may be used to associate ambiguous text
with a unique object identifier.</p>
<p>For example, many sites may wish to implement an inline "user"
directive:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
|Michael| and |Jon| are our widget-wranglers.

.. |Michael| user:: mjones
.. |Jon|     user:: jhl
</pre>
<p>Depending on the needs of the site, this may be used to index
the document for later searching, to hyperlink the inline text in
various ways (mailto, homepage, mouseover Javascript with profile
and contact information, etc.), or to customize presentation of the
text (include username in the inline text, include an icon image
with a link next to the text, make the text bold or a different
color, etc.).</p>
<p>The same approach can be used in documents which frequently
refer to a particular type of objects with unique identifiers but
ambiguous common names. Movies, albums, books, photos, court cases,
and laws are possible. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
|The Transparent Society| offers a fascinating alternate view
on privacy issues.

.. |The Transparent Society| book:: isbn=0738201448
</pre>
<p>Classes or functions, in contexts where the module or class
names are unclear and/or interpreted text cannot be used, are
another possibility:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
4XSLT has the convenience method |runString|, so you don't
have to mess with DOM objects if all you want is the
transformed output.

.. |runString| function:: module=xml.xslt class=Processor
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>Images</dt>
<dd>
<p>Images are a common use for substitution references:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
West led the |H| 3, covered by dummy's |H| Q, East's |H| K,
and trumped in hand with the |S| 2.

.. |H| image:: /images/heart.png
   :height: 11
   :width: 11
.. |S| image:: /images/spade.png
   :height: 11
   :width: 11

* |Red light| means stop.
* |Green light| means go.
* |Yellow light| means go really fast.

.. |Green light|  image:: green_light.png
.. |Yellow light| image:: yellow_light.png

|-&gt;&lt;-| is the official symbol of POEE_.

<p>The "<a class="reference external" href=
"directives.html#image">image</a> " directive has been
implemented.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Styles <a class="footnote-reference" href="#7">[7]</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Substitution references may be used to associate inline text
with an externally defined presentation style:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Even |the text in Texas| is big.

.. |the text in Texas| style:: big
</pre>
<p>The style name may be meaningful in the context of some
particular output format (CSS class name for HTML output, LaTeX
style name for LaTeX, etc), or may be ignored for other output
formats (such as plaintext).</p>
<!-- @@@ This needs to be rethought & rewritten or removed:

Interpreted text is unsuitable for this purpose because the set
of style names cannot be predefined - it is the domain of the
content author, not the author of the parser and output
formatter - and there is no way to associate a style name
argument with an interpreted text style role.  Also, it may be
desirable to use the same mechanism for styling blocks::

    .. style:: motto
       At Bob's Underwear Shop, we'll do anything to get in
       your pants.

    .. style:: disclaimer
       All rights reversed.  Reprint what you like. -->

<dd>
<p>Inline markup may be used for later processing by a template
engine. For example, a <a class="reference external" href=
"http://www.zope.com/">Zope</a> author might write:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Welcome back, |name|!

.. |name| tal:: replace user/getUserName
</pre>
<p>After processing, this ZPT output would result:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Welcome back,
&lt;span tal:replace="user/getUserName"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;!
</pre>
<p>Zope would then transform this to something like "Welcome back,
David!" during a session with an actual user.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Replacement text</dt>
<dd>
<p>The substitution mechanism may be used for simple macro
substitution. This may be appropriate when the replacement text is
repeated many times throughout one or more documents, especially if
it may need to change later. A short example is unavoidably
contrived:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
|RST|_ is a little annoying to type over and over, especially
when writing about |RST| itself, and spelling out the
bicapitalized word |RST| every time isn't really necessary for
|RST| source readability.

.. |RST| replace:: reStructuredText
.. _RST: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
</pre>
<p>Note the trailing underscore in the first use of a substitution
reference. This indicates a reference to the corresponding
hyperlink target.</p>
<p>Substitution is also appropriate when the replacement text
cannot be represented using other inline constructs, or is
obtrusively long:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
But still, that's nothing compared to a name like
|j2ee-cas|__.

.. |j2ee-cas| replace::

<div id="comments" class="section">
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Doctree element: comment.</p>
<p>Arbitrary indented text may follow the explicit markup start and
will be processed as a comment element. No further processing is
done on the comment block text; a comment contains a single "text
blob". Depending on the output formatter, comments may be removed
from the processed output. The only restriction on comments is that
they not use the same syntax as any of the other explicit markup
constructs: substitution definitions, directives, footnotes,
citations, or hyperlink targets. To ensure that none of the other
explicit markup constructs is recognized, leave the ".." on a line
by itself:</p>

<h2>Inline Markup</h2>
<p>In reStructuredText, inline markup applies to words or phrases
within a text block. The same whitespace and punctuation that
serves to delimit words in written text is used to delimit the
inline markup syntax constructs. The text within inline markup may
not begin or end with whitespace. Arbitrary <a class=
"reference internal" href=
"#character-level-inline-markup">character-level inline markup</a>
is supported although not encouraged. Inline markup cannot be
nested.</p>

<h3>Character-Level Inline Markup</h3>
<p>It is possible to mark up individual characters within a word
with backslash escapes (see <a class="reference internal" href=
"#escaping-mechanism">Escaping Mechanism</a> above). Backslash
escapes can be used to allow arbitrary text to immediately follow
inline markup:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Python ``list``\s use square bracket syntax.
</pre>
<p>The backslash will disappear from the processed document. The
word "list" will appear as inline literal text, and the letter "s"
will immediately follow it as normal text, with no space
in-between.</p>
<p>Arbitrary text may immediately precede inline markup using
backslash-escaped whitespace:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Possible in *re*\ ``Structured``\ *Text*, though not encouraged.
</pre>
<p>The backslashes and spaces separating "re", "Structured", and
"Text" above will disappear from the processed document.</p>
<div class="caution">
<p class="admonition-title">Caution!</p>
<p>The use of backslash-escapes for character-level inline markup
is not encouraged. Such use is ugly and detrimental to the
unprocessed document's readability. Please use this feature
sparingly and only where absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3>Emphasis</h3>

<h3>Interpreted Text</h3>
<p>Doctree element: depends on the explicit or implicit role and

<p>Start-string = end-string = "`".</p>
<p>Interpreted text is text that is meant to be related, indexed,
linked, summarized, or otherwise processed, but the text itself is
typically left alone. Interpreted text is enclosed by single
backquote characters:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This is `interpreted text`.
</pre>
<p>The "role" of the interpreted text determines how the text is
interpreted. The role may be inferred implicitly (as above; the
"default role" is used) or indicated explicitly, using a role
marker. A role marker consists of a colon, the role name, and
another colon. A role name is a single word consisting of
alphanumerics plus isolated internal hyphens, underscores, plus
signs, colons, and periods; no whitespace or other characters are
allowed. A role marker is either a prefix or a suffix to the
interpreted text, whichever reads better; it's up to the
author:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
:role:`interpreted text`

`interpreted text`:role:
</pre>
<p>Interpreted text allows extensions to the available inline
descriptive markup constructs. To <a class="reference internal"

"#hyperlink-references">hyperlink references</a> , we can add
"title reference", "index entry", "acronym", "class", "red",

recognized; unknown roles will generate errors. A core set of
standard roles is implemented in the reference parser; see <a
class="reference external" href="roles.html">reStructuredText
Interpreted Text Roles</a> for individual descriptions. The <a
class="reference external" href=
"directives.html#custom-interpreted-text-roles">role</a> directive

<h3>Inline Literals</h3>

<p>Text enclosed by double-backquotes is treated as inline
literals:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This text is an example of ``inline literals``.
</pre>
<p>Inline literals may contain any characters except two adjacent
backquotes in an end-string context (according to the recognition
rules above). No markup interpretation (including backslash-escape
interpretation) is done within inline literals.</p>
<p>Line breaks are <em>not</em> preserved in inline literals.
Although a reStructuredText parser will preserve runs of spaces in
its output, the final representation of the processed document is
dependent on the output formatter, thus the preservation of
whitespace cannot be guaranteed. If the preservation of line breaks
and/or other whitespace is important, <a class="reference internal"
href="#literal-blocks">literal blocks</a> should be used.</p>
<p>Inline literals are useful for short code snippets. For

floating-point numbers (without exponents).

<p>Hyperlink references are indicated by a trailing underscore,
"_", except for <a class="reference internal" href=

recognized independently. The underscore can be thought of as a
right-pointing arrow. The trailing underscores point away from
hyperlink references, and the leading underscores point toward <a
class="reference internal" href="#hyperlink-targets">hyperlink
targets</a> .</p>
<p>Hyperlinks consist of two parts. In the text body, there is a
source link, a reference name with a trailing underscore (or two
underscores for <a class="reference internal" href=
"#anonymous-hyperlinks">anonymous hyperlinks</a> ):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
See the Python_ home page for info.

<div id="embedded-uris-and-aliases" class="section">
<h4>Embedded URIs and Aliases</h4>
<p>A hyperlink reference may directly embed a target URI or (since
Docutils&nbsp;0.11) a hyperlink reference within angle brackets
("&lt;...&gt;") as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
See the `Python home page &lt;http://www.python.org&gt;`_ for info.

This `link &lt;Python home page_&gt;`_ is an alias to the link above.

<p>This is exactly equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
See the `Python home page`_ for info.

This link_ is an alias to the link above.

.. _Python home page: http://www.python.org
.. _link: `Python home page`_
</pre>
<p>The bracketed URI must be preceded by whitespace and be the last
text before the end string.</p>
<p>With a single trailing underscore, the reference is named and
the same target URI may be referred to again. With two trailing
underscores, the reference and target are both anonymous, and the
target cannot be referred to again. These are "one-off" hyperlinks.
For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
`RFC 2396 &lt;http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt&gt;`__ and `RFC
2732 &lt;http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt&gt;`__ together

</pre>
<p><a class="reference internal" href=
"#standalone-hyperlinks">Standalone hyperlinks</a> are treated as
URIs, even if they end with an underscore like in the example of a
Python function documentation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
`__init__ &lt;http:example.py.html#__init__&gt;`__
</pre>
<p>If a target URI that is not recognized as <a class=
"reference internal" href="#standalone-hyperlink">standalone
hyperlink</a> happens to end with an underscore, this needs to be
backslash-escaped to avoid being parsed as hyperlink reference. For
example</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Use the `source &lt;parrots.txt\_&gt;`__.
</pre>
<p>creates an anonymous reference to the file <tt class=
"docutils literal">parrots.txt_</tt> .</p>
<p>If the reference text happens to end with angle-bracketed text
that is <em>not</em> a URI or hyperlink reference, at least one
angle-bracket needs to be backslash-escaped or an escaped space
should follow. For example, here are three references to titles
describing a tag:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
See `HTML Element: \&lt;a&gt;`_, `HTML Element: &lt;b\&gt; `_, and
`HTML Element: &lt;c&gt;\ `_.
</pre>
<p>The reference text may also be omitted, in which case the URI
will be duplicated for use as the reference text. This is useful
for relative URIs where the address or file name is also the
desired reference text:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
See `&lt;a_named_relative_link&gt;`_ or `&lt;an_anonymous_relative_link&gt;`__

<p>This construct offers easy authoring and maintenance of

text. For documents meant to be read in source form, the use of
independent block-level <a class="reference internal" href=

recommended</strong> . The embedded URI construct is most suited to

<h3>Standalone Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Doctree element: reference.</p>
<p>Start-string = end-string = "" (empty string).</p>
<p>A URI (absolute URI <a class="footnote-reference" href=
"#uri">[10]</a> or standalone email address) within a text block is
treated as a general external hyperlink with the URI itself as the
link's text. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
See http://www.python.org for info.
</pre>
<p>would be marked up in HTML as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
See &lt;a href="http://www.python.org"&gt;http://www.python.org&lt;/a&gt; for
info.
</pre>
<p>Two forms of URI are recognized:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Absolute URIs. These consist of a scheme, a colon (":"), and a
scheme-specific part whose interpretation depends on the
scheme.</p>
<p>The scheme is the name of the protocol, such as "http", "ftp",
"mailto", or "telnet". The scheme consists of an initial letter,
followed by letters, numbers, and/or "+", "-", ".". Recognition is
limited to known schemes, per the <a class="reference external"
href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes">Official IANA
Registry of URI Schemes</a> and the W3C's <a class=
"reference external" href=
"http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes.html">Retired Index of WWW
Addressing Schemes</a> .</p>
<p>The scheme-specific part of the resource identifier may be
either hierarchical or opaque:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hierarchical identifiers begin with one or two slashes and may
use slashes to separate hierarchical components of the path.
Examples are web pages and FTP sites:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://www.python.org

ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/python
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opaque identifiers do not begin with slashes. Examples are email
addresses and newsgroups:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
mailto:someone@somewhere.com

news:comp.lang.python
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With queries, fragments, and %-escape sequences, URIs can become
quite complicated. A reStructuredText parser must be able to
recognize any absolute URI, as defined in <a class=
"reference external" href=
"http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC2396</a> and <a
class="reference external" href=
"http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt">RFC2732</a> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standalone email addresses, which are treated as if they were
absolute URIs with a "mailto:" scheme. Example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
someone@somewhere.com
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Punctuation at the end of a URI is not considered part of the
URI, unless the URI is terminated by a closing angle bracket
("&gt;"). Backslashes may be used in URIs to escape markup
characters, specifically asterisks ("*") and underscores ("_")
which are vaid URI characters (see <a class="reference internal"
