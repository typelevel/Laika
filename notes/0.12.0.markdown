New laika-io Module, Full Referential Transparency, Integration with cats-effect.

This is a breaking release, for a full migration guide, see the 
[Migration Guide](http://planet42.github.io/Laika/migration-guide-0.12.html)

* New laika-io Module
    * Functionality extracted from existing laika-core module
    * Contains File/Stream IO, EPUB output, Parallel transformations
    * Based on cats-effect type classes (in "Bring-Your-Own-Effect" style) 
    * Leaves laika-core pure, preparing it for later support for Scala.js
* Referential Transparency
    * No method in the public API throws Exceptions anymore
    * The result of pure operations is provided by instances of `Either`
    * The result of side-effecting operations is provided by a return type of `F[A]`,
      with `F[_]` being an effect type from cats-effect
    * Eliminated all uses of runtime reflection
* Changes to the APIs for creating and running parsers, renderers and transformers
    * Necessary due to the changes listed above
    * See the migration guide for details and examples  
* Changes to the Directive Syntax in Templating
    * The syntax of separators for the attribute and body sections have changed
    * HOCON syntax is now used for attributes
    * The old syntax is still supported, but will be removed at some point before the 1.0 release
* Changes to the Directive DSL for creating directives
    * `attribute(Default)` is now `defaultAttribute`
    * `body` is now either `parsedBody` or `rawBody`
    * Type conversions happen with the new `as` method: `attribute("title").as[String]`,
      based on the `ConfigDecoder` type class that is also used for the new Config API
    * Named body parts have been replaced by the more flexible Separator Directives
    * The built-in helper for mapping directive parts with different arity has
      been replaced by cats' `mapN`
* Refactoring of AST Rewrite API to be fully type-safe and avoid runtime reflection and exceptions.
    * Return types are now more explicit (e.g. `Replace(newSpan)` instead of `Some(newSpan)`)
    * Rules for rewriting spans and blocks get registered separately for increased
      type-safety, as it is invalid to replace a span with a block element.
* Refactoring of the Render API to be referentially transparent
    * Also applies to the API for registering custom renderers for individual AST nodes
* New Config API and built-in HOCON parser
    * Removed the dependency on the Typesafe Config library and its impure Java API
    * Added a new lightweight and pure HOCON parser as part of laika-core,
      supporting the full spec except for file includes (for now).
* Enhancement for the DocumentTree API      
    * The result of a tree parsing operation is now a new type called `DocumentTreeRoot`
    * It has a `coverDocument` property and contains the recursive tree structure of the parsed content.
    * Each `DocumentTree` in the structure now has an explicit `titleDocument: Option[Document]` property
      for more explicit content organization in e-books.
    * Properties that previously held references to streams and other impure data had been
      removed from the pure content model (e.g. `DocumentTree.staticDocuments`).
