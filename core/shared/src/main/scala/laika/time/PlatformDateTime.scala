/** A little abstraction that isolates aspects of parsing and formatting
  * dates from the underlying Date API which may differ between JVM
  * and Scala.js applications.
  *
  * The design is very minimal as date handling is not a core aspect of
  * Laika. For that reason it uses `java.util.Date` as the lowest common
  * denominator. Application code should convert it to the most convenient
  * type for the platform in use, e.g. with `toInstant` on the JVM or
  * with `new js.Date(date.getTime().toDouble)` in Scala.js.
  *
  * There was a deliberate choice not to depend on any of the available
  * libraries that port the `java.time` API to Scala, as this would
  * be to heavyweight, in particular for Scala.js.
