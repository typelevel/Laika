/** Defines all supported standard span directives of the reStructuredText reference parser.
  *  A span directive can be used in substitution definitions.
  *
  *  The `replace` directive is fully supported. The other directives have the following
  *  adjustments or limitations compared to their counterparts in the reference parser:
  *
  *  - `unicode`: does not support the various trim options, as that would require modifying adjacent elements
  *    (and no other directive has this requirement, therefore API/impl changes did not seem justified)
  *
  *  - `date`: Uses the patterns of `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` instead of Python's `time.strftime` function.
  *
  *  - `image`: Does not support the various layout options (`width`, `height`, `scale`, `align`), as no other
  *    tree nodes in Laika carry concrete layout information. It is recommended to use styles instead.
