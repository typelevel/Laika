/** API for creating directives, the extension mechanism of reStructuredText.
  *
  * The API did not aim to mimic the API of the original Python reference implementation.
  * Instead the goal was to create an API that is idiomatic Scala, fully typesafe and as concise as possible.
  * Yet it should be flexible enough to semantically support the options of the Python directives, so that
  * ideally most existing Python directives could theoretically get ported to Laika.
  *
  * =Comparison with Laika Directives=
  *
  * Extensions defined in the way described in this chapter could still be used when parsing the markup documents
  * with a different reStructuredText implementation, as they are fully compatible with the original specification.
  *
  * If this is not a requirement you may alternatively use the Laika variant of directives.
  * This would give you the following advantages:
  *
  * - The syntax definition is simpler, while offering the same flexibility.
  * - The directive may be used in other parsers, too, like in the Markdown parser.
  * - The directive may also be used in templates.
  * For details on these alternative directive types see
  * [[http://planet42.github.io/Laika/05-extending-laika/03-implementing-directives.html]].
  *
  * =Implementing a Directive=
  *
  * Entry points are the `BlockDirective` and `SpanDirective` objects.
  * The Python reference parser does not make this distinction on the API level,
  * but does this internally based on the context a directive is parsed in.
  * Since Laika APIs are typesafe, the distinction is necessary
  * since block level and span level directives create different types of document tree nodes.
  * A `SpanDirective` can only be used in a substitution definition which can then be used within flow elements.
  * A `BlockDirective` can be used directly in any location other block level content like paragraphs
  * or lists can be used.
  *
  * A directive may consist of any combination of arguments, fields and body elements:
  *
  * {{{
  *  .. myDirective:: arg1 arg2
  *   :field1: value1
  *   :field2: value2
  *
  *   This is the body of the directive. It may consist of any standard or custom
  *   block-level and inline markup.
  * }}}
  *
  * In the example above `arg1` and `arg2` are arguments, `field1` and `field2` are fields,
  * and followed by body elements after a blank line. If there are no arguments or fields
  * the blank line may be omitted.
  * For the full specification, see
  * [[http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#directives]].
  *
  * For each of these directive elements, the API offers a method to specify whether the element is required or optional,
  * and an optional function to convert or validate the parsed value.
  *
  * =Basic Example=
  *
  * Consider the following simple example of a directive with just one argument and a body:
  *
  * {{{
  *  .. note:: This is the title
  *
  *   This is the body of the note.
  * }}}
  *
  * The implementation of this directive could look like this:
  *
  * {{{
  *  case class Note (title: String,
  *                   content: Seq[Block],
  *                   options: Options = NoOpt) extends Block
  *                                             with BlockContainer[Note]
  *
  *  object MyDirectives extends RstExtensionRegistry {
  *    val blockDirectives = Seq(
  *      BlockDirective("note") {
  *        (argument(withWS = true) ~ blockContent).map { case title ~ content => Note(title, content) }
  *      }
  *    )
  *    val spanDirectives = Nil
  *    val textRoles = Nil
  *  )
  *
  *  val transformer = Transformer
  *    .from(ReStructuredText)
  *    .to(HTML)
  *    .using(MyDirectives)
  *    .build
  * }}}
  *
  * The `argument()` method specifies a required argument of type `String` (since no conversion function was supplied).
  * We need to set the `withWS` flag to true as an argument cannot have whitespace per default.
  * The `blockContent` method specifies standard block content (any block-level elements
  * that are supported in normal blocks, too) which results in a parsed value of type `Seq[Block]`.
  * Finally you need to provide a function that accepts the results of the specified directive elements as parameters
  * (of the corresponding type).
  * Here we created a case class with a matching signature so can pass it directly as the target function.
  * For a block directive the final result has to be of type `Block` which the `Note` class satisfies.
  * Finally the directive gets registered with the `ReStructuredText` parser.
  *
  * =Adding Converters and Validators=
  *
  * If any conversion or validation is required on the individual parts of the directive they can
  * be passed to the corresponding function:
  *
  * {{{
  *  def nonNegativeInt (value: String) =
  *    try {
  *      val num = value.toInt
  *      Either.cond(num >= 0, num, s"not a positive int: \$num")
  *    }
  *    catch {
  *      case e: NumberFormatException => Left(s"not a number: \$value")
  *    }
  *
  *  case class Message (severity: Int,
  *                      content: Seq[Block],
  *                      options: Options = NoOpt) extends Block
  *                                                with BlockContainer[Message]
  *
  *  object MyDirectives extends RstExtensionRegistry {
  *    val blockDirectives = Seq(
  *      BlockDirective("message") {
  *        (argument(nonNegativeInt) ~ blockContent).map {
  *          case severity ~ content => Message(severity, content)
  *        }
  *      }
  *    )
  *    val spanDirectives = Nil
  *    val textRoles = Nil
  *  )
  * }}}
  *
  * The function has to provide an `Either[String, T]` as a result.
  * A `Left` result will be interpreted as an error by the parser with the string being used as the message
  * and an instance of `InvalidBlock` containing the validator message
  * and the raw source of the directive will be inserted into the document tree.
  * In this case the final function (`Message`) will never be invoked.
  * A `Right` result will be used as an argument to the final function.
  * Note how the case class now expects an `Int` as the first parameter.
  *
  * =Optional Elements=
  *
  * Finally arguments and fields can also be optional. In case they are missing, the directive is still
  * considered valid and `None` will be passed to your function:
  *
  * {{{
  *  case class Message (severity: Option[Int],
  *                      content: Seq[Block],
  *                      options: Options = NoOpt) extends Block
  *                                                with BlockContainer[Message]
  *
  *  object MyDirectives extends RstExtensionRegistry {
  *    val blockDirectives = Seq(
  *      BlockDirective("message") {
  *        (optArgument(nonNegativeInt) ~ blockContent).map {
  *          case severity ~ content => Message(severity.getOrElse(0), content)
  *        }
  *      }
  *    )
  *    val spanDirectives = Nil
  *    val textRoles = Nil
  *  }
  * }}}
  *
  * The argument may be missing, but if it is present it has to pass the specified validator.
  *
  * In case of multiple arguments, the order you specify them is also the order in which they
  * are parsed from the directive markup, with the only exception being that required arguments
  * will always be parsed before optional ones, and arguments with whitespace need to come last.
