/** Configuration that specify which levels of message severity
  * will cause a transformation to fail and which will be rendered to the output.
  *
  * Several AST transformation steps can insert nodes with a message
  * into the tree and the way the runtime handles those is configurable.
  *
  * By default, `MessageFilters.defaults` will be used which does not render
  * any messages to the output and fails on severity `Error` or higher.
  * This is usually the best setting for scenarios that do not involve visual debugging.
  *
  * When running Laika in a preview server (like the one built into Laika's sbt plugin),
  * then `MessageFilters.forVisualDebugging` will be used internally.
  * This setting will never cause a transformation to fail,
  * but instead render all messages from level `Info` upwards.
  *
  * `MessageFilters.custom` allows the definition of your own combination of filters.
